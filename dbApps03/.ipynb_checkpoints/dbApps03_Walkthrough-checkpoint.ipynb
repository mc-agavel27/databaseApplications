    "### What You Learned Today:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts:**\n",
    "- ✅ Database = organized collection of data\n",
    "- ✅ DBMS = software that manages databases\n",
    "- ✅ SQLite = file-based database perfect for learning\n",
    "- ✅ SQL = language for querying databases\n",
    "- ✅ Table = structured data with rows and columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills:**\n",
    "- ✅ Convert DataFrame → SQLite database\n",
    "- ✅ Write basic SELECT queries\n",
    "- ✅ Compare pandas operations to SQL\n",
    "- ✅ Use `pd.read_sql()` to run queries\n",
    "- ✅ Explore database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Commands:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create connection\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create table from DataFrame\n",
    "df.to_sql('table_name', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run SQL query\n",
    "result = pd.read_sql(\"SELECT * FROM table_name\", conn)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close connection\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Looking Ahead to Lesson 04\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next lesson you'll learn:**\n",
    "- `WHERE` clause for filtering (like `df[df['Age'] > 30]`)\n",
    "- `ORDER BY` for sorting (like `df.sort_values()`)\n",
    "- More complex SELECT queries\n",
    "- Recreate all your Lesson 02 operations in SQL!\n",
